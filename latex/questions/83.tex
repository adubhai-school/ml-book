\section{What is reinforcement learning?}
Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning approach that involves training an agent to make decisions based on a reward signal. The basic idea is to train the agent to take actions in an environment to maximize a cumulative reward over time.

In reinforcement learning, the agent interacts with an environment and takes actions that influence the state of the environment. The environment provides feedback in the form of a reward signal, which the agent uses to update its policy for selecting actions. The goal of the agent is to learn a policy that maximizes the cumulative reward over time.

The advantages of reinforcement learning include the ability to learn in complex and dynamic environments, and the ability to learn from trial and error. Reinforcement learning has been successfully applied to a wide range of applications, including robotics, game playing, and autonomous vehicles.

However, reinforcement learning can also be challenging due to the difficulty of defining a suitable reward function and the potential for the agent to get stuck in suboptimal policies. Recent research has focused on developing new algorithms and techniques for addressing these challenges and improving the performance and efficiency of reinforcement learning systems.
