\section{What is a language model?}
A language model is a type of machine learning model that is designed to predict the likelihood of a sequence of words in a natural language. Given a sequence of words, a language model estimates the probability of observing that sequence of words, based on the probabilities of observing each word in the sequence given the preceding words.

Language models can be trained on large corpora of text, such as books, articles, or web pages, to learn the statistical patterns of natural language. Once trained, a language model can be used for a variety of natural language processing tasks, such as speech recognition, machine translation, text generation, and text classification.

One of the key applications of language models is in generating natural language text, such as in chatbots or virtual assistants. By predicting the most likely next word or phrase given the preceding words, a language model can generate fluent and coherent natural language text.

Language models can be trained using a variety of machine learning algorithms, including n-gram models, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and transformer models. The choice of algorithm depends on the complexity of the language model task and the size of the training data.
