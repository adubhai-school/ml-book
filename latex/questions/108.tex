\section{What is a hyperparameter tuning library?}
A hyperparameter tuning library is a software package that provides tools and functionalities for automating the process of hyperparameter tuning. It typically includes methods for defining a hyperparameter search space, selecting a hyperparameter optimization algorithm, and evaluating the performance of different hyperparameter configurations. Some popular hyperparameter tuning libraries include Optuna, Hyperopt, and Ray Tune. These libraries can be used with a variety of machine learning frameworks and programming languages. They can help machine learning engineers and researchers to efficiently find the best hyperparameters for their models, saving time and computational resources.
